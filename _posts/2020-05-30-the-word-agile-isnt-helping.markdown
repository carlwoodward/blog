title: The word "agile" isn't helping anyone
layout: post

Our industry (the technology / software industry) has an important problem, we use one word to describe how we do work, and that word ("agile")has a myriad of interpretations.

And other industries are looking to co-opt "agile" as a way of working, increasing the scale of confusion.

From here on out, the word "agile" won't be used. Instead tangible definitions will be used to keep intentions clear.

## Ways of structuring work

Two types of work relavant here:

1. Work that is largely operational, e.g. a bar; where the bartender's role is largely known each day and goal is to serve drinks to people.
2. Work where the challenge is creating some kind of new value. E.g. construction.

Focusing on creating new value, there are three common approaches to structuring this type of work.

| Plan, Deliver, Run | Cycles | Iteration |
| ------------------ | ------ | --------- |
| Plan for 3 months, deliver for 6 months, on going operations | Map out high level vision, run planning, delivery and in running in 1 month cycles, building towards bigger goal. | Have plan for tiny time frame, only re-plan once time frame goal is complette. |

<br/>
All of these different approaches have their benefits and drawbacks.

## Plan, Deliver, Run

- Easy to understand - most people think like this
- Upfront mapping of dependencies and dates

### What scenarios match

- Organisation knows what it is trying to achieve
- The work requires a lot of people
- Fixed but large budget

## Cycles

### Benefits

- Adapts to change in vision
- Faster feedback loop

### What scenarios match

- Organisation wants to test and pivot their approach but stick to vision and is confident in problem space
- Medium team sizes

## Iteration

### Benefits

- Find solution when problem isn't understood
- Open to new ways of creating value

### What scenarios match

- Failure is a known option
- Small investment
