Recently I started taking notes on copy paper. I Noticed that my notes were completely different to how I would take them on the computer. On copy paper they were freeform - using space as a way to organise thoughts. This lead me to experimenting with the idea of Evernote meets Google Maps.

Atlas lets you zoom between summary and the details. It is quick and easy to create maps and notes. Markdown is used to format notes, making it easy to copy and paste into other apps.

I made Atlas as a Railscamp project that helped me learn React.
